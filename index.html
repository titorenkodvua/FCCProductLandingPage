                <h2>ABOUT BREWDOG</h2>
                <p>
                    BrewDog is a brewer, retailer and distributor of drinks as well as a pub and hotel operator. While
                    the majority of our owned and operated sites are based in the U.K., we currently also have
                    breweries, taprooms and bars located in the USA, Mainland Europe, Australia and Asia - it's like the
                    greatest game of Risk ever!
                    We also work with a growing number of Franchise partners in key markets such as India, Singapore,
                    Finland and others.

                <h2>OUR PEOPLE</h2>
                <p>
                    The BrewDog group of companies employs 2000 amazing people directly. We are a UK Living Wage
                    employer and are proud to have been one since 2015.
                    We occasionally make use of agency workers, and we engage a number of third parties to supply people
                    to work in our organisation. We make it a priority to evaluate and understand the agencies which
                    provide such people and we always ensure that the contracts between us have the necessary controls
                    and procedures in place to address the Modern Slavery Act.
